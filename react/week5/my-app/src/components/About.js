        Higher Achievement is a four-year high school preparatory after-school
        program for disadvantaged urban children of various academic levels
        during middle school, 5th-8th grade. Higher Achievement's mission is to
        develop academic skills, behaviors, and attitudes in academically
        motivated and underserved middle school children to improve their
        grades, standardized test scores, attendance, and opportunities to
        attend top high school programs. Higher Achievement offers three
        year-round, community-based programs: After-School Academy; Summer
        Academy; and Top High School Placement. Higher Achievement students mark
        some of the highest gains in the country with 70 percent of all "C" (or
        below) students having increased a full letter grade or more in reading,
        68 percent of all "C" (or below) students having increased a full letter
        grade or more in math, 54 percent of students having improved their
        standardized reading score with an average increase of 9.5 percent, and
        66 percent of students having improved their standardized math score
        with an average increase of 11 percent during the 2003-2004 program
        year.
